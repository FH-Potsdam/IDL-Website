Journal Paper,"Tost Val J., Schuster P., Heidmann F. ",Prototyping Inconvenience: A Pedagogical Experiment on Designing for Debate in Design Education,IxD&A Journal,2022,,51,,81–110,,,,,,,2022,,https://doi.org/10.55612/s-5002-051-004,10.55612/s-5002-051-004 ,"With design having more impact than ever, there is an increased need for critical inquiries into design research and education that engage designers to question established disciplinary assumptions. One prevailing myth is the convenience ideal: the obsession with comfort, efficiency, smoothness, and smartness that relates to a trend of envisioning super-convenient futures. By combining iterative prototyping, anti-solutionist strategies, and tactics of critical and speculative design, we built a counter-approach to conventional design processes: Inconvenient Design. With convenience as the topic for debate, we explored its potential in the course Stranger Things–Prototyping Inconvenience. This paper provides an overview of the approach and course format, using examples of student projects to illustrate how it encouraged them to reflect and debate directly in the design process in a tangible way, enabling them to craft alternatives. Lastly, we discuss the opportunities our methodological approach can bring to design research and education.","inconvenient design, design for debate, critical design, speculative design, prototyping, provocation, design fiction, design methods, research through design, design education",

Nutzungspraktiken digitaler Kulturerbe-Daten am Beispiel musealer Sammlungen im Web. Im Zentrum steht der Einsatz von Eyetracking-Verfahren sowie Methoden der Heuristischen Usability-Evaluation. Ausgehend von den Webseiten „explorativ” gestalteter Online Sammlungen werden die grafischen Benutzungsoberflächen als visuelle Schnittstelle zwischen interner Objektdatenbank und Rezipientenschaft kritisch beleuchtet.,,

Spatial orientation allows us to judge distances regarding their temporal component. In particular, in self-motion we can estimate the duration it takes to cover a given distance, since time and spatial perception are connected. This connection can be broken with the help of Virtual Reality technology and a perceptual conflict can be created.","applied perception, gamification and serious games, virtual, mixed and augmented realities",MuC '21

Cultural collections can contain thousands of artifacts, of which each typically possesses a diverse set of properties and individual facets constituting a unique relationship to the rest of the collection. Therefore, to create an appropriate representation of the complex data of each underlying artifact, oftentimes, it is not only interesting to get an overview of the entire collection from one perspective, but to explore the specific context of an artifact and the various relations it may have to other items",,

Grounded in the field of design fiction, this work combines insights from the climate impact research community, technology meta trends, and plant science, all of which work as a basis for the exploration of relationships between humans, plants, and technology. Based on scenarios from the climate impact research community, we prototyped four plausible worlds and visualized exemplary scenes in the daily life of the plausible citizens. Sketching and low-fidelity prototyping supported the process of gaining knowledge and iterating on storytelling.","prototyping, design fiction, research through design, design methods, scenarios, visual storytelling",DIS '19
