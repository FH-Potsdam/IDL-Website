The Environmental Atlas Berlin offers not only a central access point, but also an extensive collection of environmental information. It contains diverse topics (e.g. on climate change, soil, water, air, land use) from different years, in different presentation formats (text, map, graphic, table, audio, video).

With the project, the Senate Department for Urban Development and Housing pursued the goal of improving the usability and user experience (UX) of the multimedia data and information offering. A significantly increased user-centeredness, the fast findability of information as well as the systematic linking of the different media types were central development goals of the project. 

IDL was responsible for planning and conducting a usability test to evaluate and optimize navigation and user guidance.
