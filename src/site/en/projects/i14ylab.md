Deutsche Telekom AG is currently setting up an open test and integration lab at its Winterfeldtstrasse site in Berlin-Schöneberg. Here, new approaches and possibilities for interoperability and integration are being tested for network solutions based on the principle of disaggregation of network components and developed for market implementation. The development of the Lab is funded by the Federal Ministry of Digital Affairs and Transport with EUR 17 million. The consortium consists of three major operators - Vodafone, Telefónica and Deutsche Telekom - and partners from across the industry. Together, they are testing and integrating components for disaggregated network ecosystems to provide greater flexibility, innovation and choice for all players and accelerate the time to market for disaggregated network solutions.

**Interaction Design Lab** is taking on work packages to build the i14y Lab brand and website as part of the research project. New formats of science communication - e.g. augmented reality applications - and hardware prototypes for making complex technologies experienceable will be developed.
