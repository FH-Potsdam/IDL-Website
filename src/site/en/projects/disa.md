Together with the people affected, we are developing technology-based ways of resolutely tackling social fear in everyday situations. To this end, DISA cooperates with the national Association of self-help (VSSP e. V.). The project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

Our project focuses on the broad and indeed heterogeneous group of people who suffer from a social anxiety disorder and have difficulties connecting to society. Based on social needs, DISA develops technological support options that can be used to alleviate perceived pressures of suffering or as a means of self-steering or control. The aim is for people with a social anxiety to experience greater social participation based on technology. We are also testing how to convey awareness-raising and awareness of people who are socially and fearful to people who are not directly affected. The aim is to provide effective support for self-help, which can be used in addition to therapeutic setting in order to promote meaningful experiences and stabilise social interaction.
