The transformation of a city into a smart city brings with it challenges but also possibilities such as greater inclusion of residents in decision-making processes. As part of the federal funding program "Model Project Smart Cities", prototypes for sustainable and participatory urban development are being developed together with the urban community in the Smart City of Potsdam. The focus of the dissertation project is on analyzing the accessibility of digital applications in urban planning and participation processes. With a design-based research approach it is being investigated how digital participation formats can be made more inclusive using design methods and expanded by analogue formats in order to increase their reach and give more residents the opportunity to engage in the urban development process.
