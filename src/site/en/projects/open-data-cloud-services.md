Many government organizations are working towards opening their data vaults, to drive data-driven innovation in civic tech and commercial applications alike. In its current state open data on a national level aggregated from cities and states is extremely heterogenous, making it difficult to build services and applications on top of it. With the Open Data Cloud Services (ODCS), we are trying to analyse the level of heterogenity and how to overcome it.

We are aggregating open data meta data from dozens of platforms and analyze their content. Using algorithmic processing and machine learning techniques, we unify and homogenize the data, to make it compareable and easily searchable.

Furthermore, analysing the actual raw open data, we are building an interlinked spatial taxonomy, allowing for spatial relationships to be build upon and spatial search queries to be run on the data.

The aim of the project is to provide insights into the current overall structure and quality of the open data infrastructure in Germany. In the long term, we plan on making the homogenized data accessible to the public, to increase findability and usability of public open data sets.
