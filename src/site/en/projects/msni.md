Heart of the project is a smart data-API that offers real-time access to regional data from a wide range of providers, ranging from restaurants to traffic information. Gathered and organized through a smart location- and context-based algorithm, the data is brought together in several mobile application prototypes. Our main focus lies in developing an in-depth user experience through design research and thoughtful interactions and designs. The evaluated prototypes should provide insights into the fields of recommendation behaviour, navigation, privacy, and cross-cultural design, etc.

MSNI is a research project of the design department of the University of Applied Sciences in Potsdam and is funded by the <a href="http://www.bmbf.de" target="_blank">German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)</a>.
