With the development of the Energy Atlas the "Energy Turnaround" is becoming more than a rhetorical figure for Rhineland-Palatinate. The web portal offers a rich variety of information on renewable energy. The interested public can require information on all aspects of renewable energy and heating from the production, through transport down to the energy consumption of the last few years. Specific projects are introduced in detail, to offer insights into what actions are helping to make the energy turnaround a reality. All the information is georeferenced and is available through maps and various search interfaces.

The energy agency of Rhineland-Palatinate uses the energy atlas to support the government itself, as well as public institutions, companies, or the general public. Aiming at going beyond simply informing stakeholders, the platform should help interest groups to initialize their own projects in the area of renewable energy, energy efficiency and saving energy.

In this 1-year cooperation with the company DELPHI IMM GmbH, the **Interaction Design Lab** was responsible for a user-centered information- and navigation architecture, as well as the actual design of the responsive site, the geographic visualizations and the overall interaction concept. In order to ensure a high level of usability, the **Interaction Design Lab** performed several usability studies along the development process including a concluding eye tracking study.
