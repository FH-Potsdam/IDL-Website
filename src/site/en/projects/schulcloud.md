The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Engineering (HPI) is developing a school cloud together with MINT-EC, the national excellence school network of over 300 schools nationwide, and supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The school cloud is intended to create the technical basis for teachers and students to also be able to use modern digital teaching and learning content in every subject, in the same way that apps can be used via smartphones or tablets.

To continuously improve the user experience (UX) and to ensure the usability of the school cloud user interfaces, **Interaction Design Lab** has conducted a "UX Expert Screening" of the school cloud. In this process, UX experts evaluate the school cloud user interfaces along selected usage scenarios with regard to established usability and UX principles such as task appropriateness, conformity to expectations, or individualizability, as well as with regard to formal-aesthetic criteria and the use of current interaction design patterns for smartphones and tablets.
