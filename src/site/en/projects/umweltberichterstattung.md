The focus of this project was the development of innovative and systematic products for the provision of environmental information in order to expand access to environmental topics as well as to better address different user groups. For this purpose, the needs and possibilities were identified, also on the basis of best practice examples. The needs assessment was supported by a co-design workshop, in which heterogeneous user groups prepared their requirements graphically in a creative process.

Based on the results of the requirements analysis, Studio NAND developed an interactive data visualization to make it easier to experience the systemic interrelationships of environmental issues. The implementation of the interrelationships mainly refers to two major areas: First, it is about the analysis and presentation of cross-topic interrelationships of the articles on the Federal Environment Agency website. Using text mining, all articles on the Federal Environment Agency website are examined and analyzed for relevant environmental terms. In an interactive visualization, the terms found can be presented individually for specific questions in an impact model, in which, among other things, connections between causes, measures and effects are considered.

**Interaction Design Lab** is responsible for the analysis of user needs, personae development, as well as the conception, realization and evaluation of the co-design workshop with stakeholders from environmental reporting, policy consulting, and the public sector.
