Digitization has also profoundly changed the design discipline. Designing with and through code is becoming increasingly important in the conception, design and production of design artefacts and digital services. The teaching platform **Parametric Design** is used in the basic studies in the design courses of the Design department of the FH Potsdam to teach digital skills.

The transfer of skills covers the entire spectrum, from design to production processes with e.g. laser cutters or 3D printers. When developing the offers, special emphasis was placed on multi-modal learning. Exploratory or guided learning, text or video, is combined with face-to-face events to deepen the content.

When creating the content, an attempt was made to make it as barrier-free as possible. All content can be developed through texts, consumed via video in German and English including subtitles or videos in sign language. This is supplemented by interactive elements.
