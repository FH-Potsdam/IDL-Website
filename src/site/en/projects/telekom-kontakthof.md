The project involves the design and realization of a temporary "Living Lab" for smart urban infrastructures. The location is a 400-square-meter space on the seventh floor of the Telekom "Digital Innovation Arena" building at Winterfeldtstrasse 21 in Berlin-Schöneberg. As part of the project, students have developed and prototyped new ideas for supporting basic urban functions of existence (mobility, supply, communication, work, education, recreation) through innovative smart city services and context-sensitive objects in the "Smart Urban Street Furniture" urban space.
