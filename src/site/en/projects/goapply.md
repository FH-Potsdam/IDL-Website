The European project GoApply "Multidimensional Governance of Climate Change Adaptation in Policy Making and Practice" aims at increasing the understanding of discourse processes between stakeholders affected by climate change in the Alpine Space in order to improve the development of common adaptation strategies and to prepare decisions on concrete measures more effectively. Within this framework, an interactive visualization (data graphic) of the specific "Climate Adaptation Governance" activities of the participating countries (Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein and Slovenia) was conceived, designed and implemented as a web interface.
