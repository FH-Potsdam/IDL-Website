As part of the 5-year joint project "InnoWest", researchers from FH Potsdam, THB and HNEE are focusing on sustainable development in the rural areas of North-West Brandenburg. In addition to projects on sustainable education and construction, we focus on user-centred and data-based solutions for civil society, administration and industry. With the involvement of local and regional actors, innovative applications are to be developed to support and accompany the transformation processes in rural areas.
