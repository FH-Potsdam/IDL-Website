Modern digital services need to be designed and build to run on various platforms and devices, integrating themselves seamlessly into each architecture for intuitive interactions. Fraunhofer FOKUS is developing and running the KatWarn early warning system in Germany. A digital infrastructure delivering warnings from authorities to citizens.

Since 2013 the IDL is supporting Fraunhofer Fokus by building an integrated and user-friendly design system across a variety of eco-systems. From iOS devices to Android and Windows Phone, to Smart Watches like the Apple Watch, to public displays of varying sizes. Each with their own design methodology and requirements, which designs need to be adapted to, while maintaining the design identity of the system.

In contrast to common information- and warning-systems, KatWarn is location-based and personalized, this means that you can not only tell your application to observe a certain location, like for example your home address and your parents address, but in addition you can receive real time information for your current location.
