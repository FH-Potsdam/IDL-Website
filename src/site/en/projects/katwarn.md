In summer of 2013 Fraunhofer FOKUS commissioned the IDL to redesign the KatWarn iOS application and adapt the interfaces for Android and Windows Phone. The innovative early warning system for citizens is designed to warn the public in the case of an emergency, from natural hazzards like blizzards and flooding, to large scale operations within the city. In contrast to common information- and warning-systems, KatWarn is location based and personalized, this means that you can not only tell your application to observe a certain location, like for example your home address and your parents address, but in addition you can receive real time information for your current location.
