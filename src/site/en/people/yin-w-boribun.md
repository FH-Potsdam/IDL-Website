Yin identifies himself as a passionate Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Designer and researcher, with a strong affinity for this field. With a Bachelor's degree in Game Design (HTW Berlin) and more than 7 years of experience as a Senior Intermedia Designer, he possesses a broad range of skills, including designing user-centric applications, crafting immersive experiences in the digital realm, and developing innovative interaction methods.

In his role as an HCI Designer, Yin nurtures a profound interest in exploring, optimizing, and developing intuitive, user-friendly interfaces to elevate the interaction between humans and technology.

His expertise spans across various domains:

• Designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces 
• Virtual Reality (VR) design 
• Augmented Reality (AR) design 
• Eye-Based interactions (Tobii) 
• XR-Experience-Design (HoloLens 2) 
• Physical Computing

In his master's thesis, Yin focuses on empirically examining the utilization of XR technology in the collaborative design process and concurrently develops a prototype to investigate its potential for this purpose.
