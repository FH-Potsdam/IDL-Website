In the PROTOTYP project she investigates prototypes as a communication medium of possible futures. In the DISA project she investigates digital inclusion in the context of social anxiety. Her focus is on participatory prototyping with affected people.\n\nShe also works as a freelance consultant for design processes and co-design.\n\nHer research focuses on Research Through Design and design methodology with a particular interest in prototyping."
