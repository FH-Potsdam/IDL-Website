After a bachelor's degree in industrial design at the FH Magdeburg-Stendal, Rahel studied interaction design at the FH Potsdam. Since 2013 she has worked for different design studios and research institutions. In 2020, she joined FH Potsdam and is working on the research project DISA on digital inclusion in the context of social anxiety disorders. An important concern and focus of her work is the involvement of the target group in the development and design process through participatory workshops and co-creation processes.
Another focus of her work is bringing ideas to life through prototyping â€“ digitally or physically, preferably somewhere in between.
