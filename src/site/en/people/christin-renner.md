Christin is a Research Associate at the Interaction Design Lab (IDL) at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam.

Christin was already involved in the research field of <i>human-technology-interaction</i> during her studies at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam. In 2016, she completed her bachelor's degree in communication design with honor. Her thesis was devoted to the social changes that go hand in hand with the increasing acceleration of our pace of life and the question of how design can make a contribution to making these changes visible. She deepened her studies with a Master of Arts in Interface Design at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam in 2018. In her thesis, she examined how the increasing digitalization of our everyday life is fundamentally changing our society.

Christin has been working as a freelance designer on various projects. Among other things, she was involved in projects with the Hochschulforum Digitalisierung, the GeoFab Netzwerk, the Umweltbundesamt and the Telekom Innovation Laboratories.

Since 2020 Christin has been a Research Associate in the BMBF-funded project <i>DataSkop</i>, which is dedicated to the development of innovative user interfaces and visualizations to promote digital autonomy.
