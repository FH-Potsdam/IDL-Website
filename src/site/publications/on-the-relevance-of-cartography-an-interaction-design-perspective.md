  body: "We see more cartographic products in our digital world than ever before. But what role does cartography play in the modern production of cartographic products? In this position paper, we will argue that the democratization and diffusion of cartographic production has also led to the presumed \"fading relevance\" of cartography. As an argument against this notion, we highlight starting points for the field of cartography to improve modern cartographic production through its inherent cartographic knowledge."
