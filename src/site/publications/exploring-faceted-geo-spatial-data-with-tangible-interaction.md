  body: "In this paper we introduce a case study on tangible geo-visualization on an interactive tabletop to enable the exploration of architectural projects in Venice. The tangible user interface consists of a large display showing projects on a map, and a polyhedral object to browse these data interactively by selecting and filtering various metadata facets. With the object we aim to reduce the barrier between the physical world and virtual data, and ease the understanding of faceted geo-spatial data"
