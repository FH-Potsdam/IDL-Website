ProSeco is a collaborative research project in the framework of the Central Innovation Programme (ZIM) for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which is funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). The goal of the research project is the development of a web-based dashboard for different user types (admin, IT manager, etc.), which enables these users to observe the metrics of in-house IT-security systems. To achieve this, we are currently developing a custom-built format that can be used to supervise and process different data sources from the existing IT-infrastructure (e.g. network traffic, RSS-Feeds, Firewall log files). Based on the aggregation of these data sources, which are collected from the in-house IT-security system, this method enables us to generate different security visualisations in the dashboard, supported by state-of-the-art data visualisation libraries (e.g d3). Based on user-centered design methods and the input of participating IT-security experts, we created a first prototype that demonstrates a use case for a web-based modular middleware concept.
